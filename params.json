{"name":"HDFCRAFT","tagline":"Make Data Fun!","body":"### Welcome to HDFCRAFT GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n Minecraft is a popular game among K-12 students. Minecraft allows players to manipuate textured cubes in a 3D generated world. This project demonstrates how to use NASA Earth science data in HDF to create a Minecraft world. The goal is to give students an early exposure to NASA Earth data and let them explore a world observed by NASA satellites with Minecraft.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* JDK 1.7 or above\r\n* IntelliJ\r\n* Minecraft for PC or Mac\r\n** Demo version is OK but full version is recommended because Creative Mode allows you to view the map globally.\r\n* HDFView\r\n\r\n### HDF\r\n\r\n  HDF is a binary file format for storing scientific data. Many NASA Earth data are distributed in this format. An HDF file contains one or more datasets in different shape: 360x180, 15x1440x720, 721 x 721, etc. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of datasets by reading the data product document from NASA and examining the HDF file content with HDFView.\r\n\r\n### Building Minecraft Map\r\n\r\n  Once you decided which dataset in HDF to use, you can create a map with either HDFCRAFT desktop or server. The desktop version is based on WorldPainter. The server version is based on Glowstone. The desktop is easy to build a map but it is only good for 2D dataset due to the 2.5D nature of WorldPainter. The server version is difficult to build a map but provides the full 3D flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@hyoklee modified sources from [WorldPainter](http://www.worldpainter.net/) and [Glowstone](http://www.glowstone.net).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nPlease issue a GitHub ticket.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
