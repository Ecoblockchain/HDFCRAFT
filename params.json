{"name":"HDFCRAFT","tagline":"Making Data Fun!","body":"### Welcome to HDFCRAFT GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n Minecraft is a popular game among K-12 students. Minecraft allows players to manipuate textured cubes in a 3D generated world. This project demonstrates how to use NASA Earth science data in HDF to create a Minecraft world. The goal is to give students an early exposure to NASA Earth data and let them explore a world observed by NASA satellites with Minecraft.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* [JDK] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 7 or 8\r\n* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)\r\n* [HDFView](http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/release/download.html)\r\n* [toolsUI](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/index.jsp)\r\n* [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/download)  for Windows/Mac/Linux.\r\n\r\nDemo version of Minecraft is OK but Full version is recommended for Creative Mode and Multiplayer. The Creative Mode allows you to view the map globally. Multiplayer mode allows you to connect to a Minecraft server.\r\n\r\n### HDF\r\n\r\n  HDF is a binary file format for storing scientific data. Many NASA Earth data are distributed in this format. An HDF file contains one or more datasets in different shape: 360x180, 15x1440x720, 721 x 721, etc. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of datasets by reading data usage guide from NASA and by examining the HDF file content with HDFView and toolsUI.\r\n\r\n### Building Minecraft World\r\n\r\n  Once you decided which dataset in HDF to use, you can create a map with either HDFCRAFT [desktop](https://github.com/hyoklee/HDFCRAFT) or [server](https://github.com/hyoklee/Glowstone). The desktop version is based on WorldPainter. The server version is based on Glowstone. The desktop version is easier to build a map but it is less expressive due to the 2.5D nature of WorldPainter. The server version is difficult to build a map but provides the full 3D capability.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@hyoklee modified sources from [WorldPainter](http://www.worldpainter.net/) and [Glowstone](http://www.glowstone.net).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nPlease issue a GitHub ticket.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
